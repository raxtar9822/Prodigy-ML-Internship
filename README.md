# Machine learning Internship Tasks
## Task-01: Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
 - Dataset: Custom 
 - Machine Learning tasks: Linear Regression Model
 - Tool: Google Colab

## Task-02: Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
 - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
 - Tool: Google Colab and kaggle

## Task-03: Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
 - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
 - Machine Learning tasks: Support Vector Machine
 - Tool: Jupyter Notebook

## Task-04: Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
 - Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog
 - Machine Learning tasks: Tensor flow and keras
 - Tool: Google Colab and Kaggle

  
## Note
- I have worked on four tasks provided in the internship.
- Still working on food101 dataset(Soon it will be updated).
